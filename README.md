# Geography Trivia

A nice concise quiz about geography!

## What this game is under the covers

This quiz was made to understand timers and how to use them to both give the user a limited time to do some sort of action and to use them to prevent action and wait. I also used this quiz to really hammer home using javascript classes to make the program scalable and modular. ADding questions are as easy as adding elements to an array!
